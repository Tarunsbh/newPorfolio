                                            such as third-party vendors and technology providers, was crucial in

                                            • Enhanced Customer Support and Communication: Collaborating closely with
                                            internal stakeholders, such as product marketing, sales, and support teams,

                                            existing integrations or products. By driving updates and enhancements
                                            through cross- functional teams, we were able to continuously improve the
